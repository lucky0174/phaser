## What's new in Phaser 2.3.0

<div align="center"><img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/news.jpg"></div>

> 26th March 2015

Phaser 2.3.0 marks the second release in 2015 and easily one of our most significant for a while. In terms of API changes they're actually quite minimal, but under the hood we've taken Phaser for a serious workout.

We've traditionally had something of a 'kitchen sink' issue with Phaser. As we thought of great new features to give you we just added them in. And like too much of a good thing they contributed to an ever growing file size.

So two of the biggest changes 2.3.0 has is an internal shift to using Game Object components, and allowing you to exclude features in your own custom builds. The new build system lets you selectively exclude features from being bundled in: for example if your game doesn't need Gamepad or Keyboard support you can now tell Phaser to skip those parts entirely.

[This tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) explains the process in detail. But the end result is that thanks to these changes we've both managed to remove thousands of lines of code and let you decide what Phaser contains. The minimum build size is now just 83KB minified and gzipped and that's still including both the WebGL and Canvas renderers.

Even though we've been cutting down on size we still managed to pack a whole load of great new features in. For example the new spacial sorting added to Arcade Physics allows for incredible speed increases when dealing with densely populated game worlds. The Loader has received a complete overhaul - now offering full parallel asset loading, sync points and more! The Tilemap system was upgraded to support new Tiled 0.11 editor features. Audio has been also been enhanced, with better marker and loop handling. See the Change Log for all the details.

Your games will run faster, have a smaller footprint and load faster than ever.

But it's not just Phaser that has been updated - we also finally released the [new Phaser web site](http://phaser.io)! For the past few years it was a huge "wall of text", with hundreds of links filling up the single page site. Now it's all changed! with a much more attractive layout and structure. We've got a healthy and constantly updating [news section](http://phaser.io/news), the [examples](http://phaser.io/examples) have a great new visual showcase and there's even a [Sandbox](http://phaser.io/sandbox) to play in.

It was a lot of hard work but we're super-happy with the result - and judging by our page hits, which are going off the charts, you are too :) We'll be sure to keep enhancing it over the coming months, especially as Phaser 3 development ramps up.

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy Phaser 2.3.0, the new site, the new features and the New Year. Happy coding everyone! See you on the forums.

Cheers,

Rich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/learn.jpg" align="right">

We have a [Getting Started Guide](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) which covers all you need to begin developing games with Phaser. From setting up a web server, to picking an IDE and coding your first game.

Prefer **videos** to reading? Lynda.com have published a free course: [HTML5 Game Development with Phaser](http://www.lynda.com/Phaser-tutorials/HTML5-Game-Development-Phaser/163641-2.html)

The single biggest Phaser resource is the new [Phaser web site](http://phaser.io/news). It has hundreds of tutorials listed and fresh ones are added every week, so keep coming back to see what's new!

Using Phaser with **TypeScript**? Check out this great series of [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx) tutorials.

### Source Code Examples

Ever since we started Phaser we've been growing and expanding our extensive set of source code examples. Currently there are over 500 of them!

Browse the [Phaser Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) or clone the [examples repo][examples] and eat your heart out!

### Phaser Books

<div align="center"><img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/books.jpg"></div>

We've been busy writing books about Phaser. Available now:

* [A Guide to the Phaser Tween Manager](https://leanpub.com/phasertweenmanager) Book + Code Bundle
* [A Guide to the Phaser Scale Manager](https://leanpub.com/phaserscalemanager)

With more on the way. [Vote on the next title](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/10962-which-phaser-book-would-you-like-to-see-next/) to be written.

### Game Mechanic Explorer

The [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com) is a great interactive way to learn how to develop specific game mechanics in Phaser. Well worth exploring once you've got your dev environment set-up.

### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor

[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="using-phaser"></a>
## Using Phaser

Phaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development and the minified version for production.

### Custom Builds

As of Phaser 2.3.0 we now include a brand new build system which allows you to strip out lots of additional features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then you can now exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be stripped out too.

As a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 83KB minified and gzipped.

See the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.

### Building from source

Should you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.

Run `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.

If you change either Pixi.js or P2 then use the Grunt tasks `replace:pixi` and `replace:p2` respectively. These tasks patch their UMD strings so they work properly with Phaser under requireJS.

<a name="games"></a>
## Games made with Phaser

Thousands of games have been made in Phaser. From game jam entries to titles for some of the largest entertainment brands in the world. This is just a tiny sample.

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

Phaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.

While Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with regard to memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.

### IE9

If you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x **and** use P2 physics then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Phaser is developed in JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't *force* you to. It's your choice.

If you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="road-map"></a>
## Road Map

All Phaser development is now taking place on the Phaser 3 project. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported and issues fixed, but roadmap features have been migrated over to Phaser 3.

<a name="phaser3"></a>
## Phaser 3

We're now several months in to development of Phaser 3. We've been working hard on creating a brand new and extremely powerful renderer. Progress reports are posted to the web site and [Phaser 3 repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3).

There is still plenty of time to add your suggestions and feedback in [this forum thread](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread/).

If you are an exceptional JavaScript developer and would like to join the Phaser 3 development team then let us know. We have a limited budget available to pay towards your time.

## Change Log

Version 2.3.1 - "Katar" - in dev

### New Features

* Tilemap.getTileWorldXY has a new optional parameter: `nonNull` which if set makes it behave in the same way as `getTile` does (thanks @GGAlanSmithee #1722)
* Group.hash is an array (previously available as `Group._hash`, but protected) into which you can add any of its children via `Group.addToHash` and `Group.removeFromHash`. Only children of the Group can be added to and removed from the hash. The hash is used automatically by Arcade Physics in order to perform non z-index based destructive sorting. However if you don't use Arcade Physics, or it isn't a physics enabled Group, then you can use the hash to perform your own sorting and filtering of Group children without touching their z-index (and therefore display draw order).
* Group.physicsSortDirection is a new property allowing you to set a custom sort direction for Arcade Physics Sprites within the Group hash. Previously Arcade Physics used one single sort direction (defined on `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.sortDirection`) but this change allows you to specifically control how each and every Group is sorted, so you can now combine tall and wide Groups with narrow and thin in a single system.
* Cache.getPixiTexture will return a PIXI.Texture from the cache based on the given key. A PIXI Texture is created automatically for all images loaded and added to the cache.
* Cache.getPixiBaseTexture will return a PIXI.BaseTexture from the cache based on the given key. A PIXI BaseTexture is created automatically for all images loaded and added to the cache.

### Updates

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @clark-stevenson @isuda @ggarek)
* Added missing `resumed` method to Phaser.State class template.
* Color.webToColor and Color.updateColor now updates the `out.color` and `out.color32` properties (thanks @cuixiping #1728)
* Tilemap.createFromObjects has been updated for Tiled 0.11 and can now look-up object layers based on id, uid or name. It will also now copy over Sprite scaling properties if set (thanks @mandarinx #1738)
* Graphics.drawPolygon can now accept a Phaser.Polygon or PIXI.Polygon object, as well as a points array (#1712)
* Phaser.Physics hooks added in for MatterJS support (coming soon)
* Body.destroy now automatically calls `Group.removeFromHash`.
* Physics.Arcade.sort has a new property 'sortDirection'. If not specified it will use World.sortDirection. If the Group given as the first parameter has its `physicsSortDirection` property set that will override any other setting.
* Physics.Arcade.sort now calls one of four functions: sortLeftRight, sortRightLeft, sortTopBottom and sortBottomTop. Each of which takes 2 Sprites as arguments.
* Physics.Arcade.sort now doesn't bail out if the Group contains a mixture of physics and non-physics enabled objects, as the Group hash is now only ever populated with physics enabled objects. Also the sort comparison functions no longer return -1 if the bodies are invalid, but zero instead (#1721)
* Group would automatically add a child into the _hash array as soon as the child was created (or moved into the Group). This no longer happens. Instead the child is only added to Group.hash if it is enabled for Arcade Physics. However Group.addToHash and the hash array have been exposed in case you were taking advantage of the _hash even though it was a private array.
* Cache.getTexture has now been removed (it was deprecated several versions ago). Use Cache.getRenderTexture instead.
* Removed duplicate methods from PIXI.Text such as wordWrap and updateText as Phaser overrides them, so it was wasting bytes.

### Bug Fixes

* The LoadTexture component has had a redundant `dirty` call removed from it.
* TileSprites were missing a `physicsType` property, causing them to not collide with anything (thanks @numbofathma #1702)
* Sprite was missing the Health and InCamera components.
* A Tween could be incorrectly set to never end if it was given a duration of zero (thanks @hardalias #1710)
* Added guards around `context.getImageData` calls in BitmapData, Text and Canvas Tinting classes to avoid crashing restricted browsers like Epic Browser. Please understand that several Phaser features won't work correctly with this browser (thanks @Erik3000 #1714)
* P2 Body.destroy now checks for the existence of a `sprite` property on the body before nulling it (thanks @englercj #1736)
* The version of p2.js being used in 2.3.0 wasn't correctly declaring itself as a global for browserify / requireJS. This update resolves that (thanks @dgoemans #1723)
* AnimationManager.frameName setter wasn't checking if `_frameData` existed before accessing it (thanks @nesukun #1727)
* P2.getConstraints would return an array of null objects. It now returns the raw p2 constraint objects (thanks @valueerrorx #1726)
* TilemapLayer docs incorrectly reported it as extending Phaser.Image, but it doesn't share the same components so has been updated.
* TilemapLayer was missing the Input component (thanks @uhe1231 #1700)
* PIXI.Graphics in Canvas mode wouldn't respect the objects visible or alpha zero properties, rendering it regardless (thanks @TimvdEijnden #1720)
* Enabling Arcade Physics would add the deltaCap property onto Phaser.Time, even though the property doesn't exist any more, changing the class shape in the process.
