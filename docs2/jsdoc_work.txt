JSDOC3 Work:

1) This should go at the top of every file (with the module name corrected)

/**

* @license      https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/license.txt  MIT License
* @module       Phaser.Animation
*/

2) This is the format a constructor should be:

/**
* The constructor description goes here. If there isn't one for you to paste in, just put TODO.
*
* @class Phaser.Animation
* @constructor
* @param {Phaser.Game} game - A reference to the currently running game.
* @param {Phaser.Sprite} parent - A reference to the owner of this Animation.
* @param {string} name - The unique name for this animation, used in playback commands.
* @param {Phaser.Animation.FrameData} frameData - The FrameData object that contains all frames used by this Animation.
* @param {(Array.<number>|Array.<string>)} frames - An array of numbers or strings indicating which frames to play in which order.
* @param {number} delay - The time between each frame of the animation, given in ms.
* @param {boolean} looped - Should this animation loop or play through once.
*/

You must ensure the class is correct and it has the @constructor tag.
It is important you include the data-type. I don't expect you to know what the data type is, so just include: {todo}
It is important you include the hypen after the parameter name. You will always know what the parameter name is, so it should always be included.
You often won't know what the parameter description is, so just put "todo", like this:

* @param {todo} name - todo.

3) Functions are nearly exactly the same as the constructor:

/**
* The function description goes here. If there isn't one for you to paste in, just put TODO.
*
* @method play
* @param {Number} [frameRate=null] The framerate to play the animation at.
* @return {Phaser.Animation} A reference to this Animation instance.
*/

You must ensure the @method tag is correct and present.
It is important you include the data-type. I don't expect you to know what the data type is, so just include: {todo}
It is important you include the hypen after the parameter name. You will always know what the parameter name is, so it should always be included.
You often won't know what the parameter description is, so just put "todo", like this:

* @param {todo} name - todo.

4) All properties must be marked-up:

/**
* @property {boolean} isFinished - The finished state of the Animation. Set to true once playback completes, false during playback.
* @default
*/
this.isFinished = false;

It is important you include the data-type. I don't expect you to know what the data type is, so just include: {todo}
It is important you include the hypen after the parameter name. You will always know what the parameter name is, so it should always be included.
You often won't know what the parameter description is, so just put "todo", like this:

* @property {todo} isFinished - todo.

If the property has a base value assigned to it (i.e. a number or a string) then put @default.
If the property starts with an underscore it must include @private. Here is an example combining the two:

/**
* @property {number} _frameIndex - The index of the current frame.
* @private
* @default
*/
this._frameIndex = 0;
