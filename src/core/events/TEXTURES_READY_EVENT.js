 * The Game Boot Texture Manager is Ready Event.

 * When a Phaser Game instance is booting for the first time, the Texture Manager has to wait on a couple of non-blocking
 * async events before it's fully ready to carry on. When those complete the Texture Manager emits this event via the Game
 * instance, which tells the Game to carry on booting.
