/**
* Phaser - http://www.phaser.io
*
* v1.0.0 - Released at some point during 2013
*
* @author Richard Davey http://www.photonstorm.com @photonstorm
*
* A feature-packed 2D HTML5 game framework born from the smouldering pits of Flixel and
* constructed via plenty of blood, sweat, tears and coffee by Richard Davey (@photonstorm).
*
* Many thanks to Adam Saltsman (@ADAMATOMIC) for releasing Flixel, from both which Phaser
* and my love of game development originate.
*
* Internally Phaser uses pixi.js by Mat Groves http://matgroves.com/ @Doormat23 for rendering.
