/**
 * Calculates and returns the vertical overlap between two arcade physics bodies.
 * 
 * We know the bodies are intersecting based on a previous check, so the point of this function
 * is to determine which face the overlap is occurring on and at what depth.
 *
 * @function Phaser.Physics.Arcade.GetOverlapY
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body1 - The first Body to separate.
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body2 - The second Body to separate.
 * @param {boolean} [overlapOnly] - Is this an overlap only check, or part of separation?
 * @param {number} [bias] - A value added to the delta values during collision checks. Increase it to prevent sprite tunneling (sprites passing through each other instead of colliding).
 *
 * @return {number[]} An array containing the amount of overlap in element 0 and the face of body1 in element 1 (true = bottom, false = top).
