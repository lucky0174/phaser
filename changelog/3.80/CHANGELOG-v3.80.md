# Version 3.80.0 - Yotsuba - in dev

# Updates

* The `TweenChainBuilder` was incorrectly setting the `persist` flag on the Chain to `true`, which goes against what the documentation says. It now correctly sets it to `false`. This means if you previously had a Tween Chain that was persisting, it will no longer do so, so add the property to regain the feature.
