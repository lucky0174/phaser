## Arcade Physics New Features

* The Arcade Physics World has a new property `tileFilterOptions` which is an object passed to the `GetTilesWithin` methods used by the Sprite vs. Tilemap collision functions. These filters dramatically reduce the quantity of tiles being checked for collision, potentially saving thousands of redundant math comparisons from taking place.
