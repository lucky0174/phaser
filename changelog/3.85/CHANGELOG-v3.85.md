# Version 3.85.0 - Itsuki - in development

# Round Pixels

Includes a **Potentially Breaking Change**

The way `roundPixels` has been handled in this release has been changed significantly. In previous versions we passed a uniform to the shaders and handled the pixel rounding on the GPU. However, this caused issues with our batching flow - for example, a Sprite would need to be rounded, but a Text or Shape object would not. This lead to complications in some parts of the render code.

In this release we have removed the shader uniform and branching and also made `roundPixels` default to `false` in the Game Config. Previously, it was `true`, so you may need to switch this flag if you were relying on it. Here are the results of this change:

* The Game Config `roundPixels` property now defaults to `false`.
* The `uRoundPixels` uniform has been removed from the Single, Multi and Mobile vertex shaders.
* Setting the `uRoundPixels` uniform has been removed from the Single, Rope, PreFX, PostFX, Multi and Mobile WebGL Pipelines.
* The Multi Pipeline and Blitter WebGL Renderer will now pass the `camera.roundPixels` value to the Transform Matrix `setQuad` method.
* The Multi Pipeline `batchSprite` and `batchTexture` methods will now apply `Math.floor` to the sprite matrix calculations if camera round pixels is enabled.
* `BaseCamera.preRender` has been removed. This method was completely overridden by `Camera.preRender` which is the method that contained the correct rendering logic. As the Base Camera variant was not used internally we have removed it to save space.
* `Camera.preRender` has been updated to use both zoomX and zoomY for the matrix transform.
* `Camera.preRender` has been updated to apply Math.floor to the scroll factor when rounding is enabled on the Camera. This fixes an issue where following sprites with Camera lerp, or heavy zoom factors, would cause 'stuttering' at sub-pixel values.

# New Features

* `BaseSoundManager.isPlaying` is a new method that will return a boolean if the given sound key is playing. If you don't provide a key, it will return a boolean if any sound is playing (thanks @samme)
* `WebGLRenderer.dispatchContextLost` is a new internal method that is called when the WebGL context is lost. By default this is bound to the property `WebGLRenderer.contextLostHandler`. If you override the context loss handler, be sure to invoke this method in due course.
* `WebGLRenderer.dispatchContextRestore` is a new internal method that is called when the WebGL context is restored. By default this is bound to the property `WebGLRenderer.contextRestoreHandler`. If you override the context restore handler, be sure to invoke this method in due course.
* `WebGLRenderer.setContextHandlers` is a new internal method with 2 optional parameters: `contextLost` and `contextRestored`. These allow you to overwrite the default `contextLostHandler` and `contextRestoreHandler` handlers. (thanks @yaustar)
* `Phaser.Textures.Frame#setCutPosition` is a new internal method with 2 optional parameters: `x` and `y`. These sets the x and y position within the source image to cut from.
* `Phaser.Textures.Frame#setCutSize` is a new internal method with 2 parameters: `width` and `height`. These sets the width, and height of the area in the source image to cut. (thanks @FelipeIzolan)
* Introduced new constants in `ORIENTATION_CONST`. The constants `LANDSCAPE_SECONDARY` and `PORTRAIT_SECONDARY` have been added to the `Phaser.Scale.Orientation` object. These constants represent the secondary landscape and portrait orientations respectively. This addition provides more granular control over device orientation handling in Phaser. Fix #6837 (thanks @rexrainbow)
* Introduced `updateConfig` method in `ParticleEmitter` to allow dynamic updating of Particle Emitter configurations. This method enables existing properties to be overridden and new properties to be added to the emitter's configuration. It ensures that the emitter is reset with the updated configuration for more flexible particle effects management.
* A new `wrap` method has been natively integrated into the `Body` class to replace the existing `MatterWrap` plugin. [Here's how it works](MatterWrapBounds.md).
* The Matter `attractors` plugin has been natively integrated into the `Body` class and Matter engine. [More details here](MatterAttractor.md).
* Added functionality to the `Phaser.Textures.DynamicTexture#clear` method. Clear a specific area within a `Dynamic Texture` by specifying `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` parameters to clear only a portion of the texture. Fix #6853 (thanks @SelfDevTV)
* Added functionality to the `Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.RenderTarget#clear` method. Clear a specific area within the `RenderTarget` by specifying `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` parameters.
* Added Default Image Handling in `TextureManager`. In the game `config`, set `defaultImage` to `null` to ignore loading the `defaultImage`.
* Added Missing Image Handling in `TextureManager`. In the game `config`, set `missingImage` to `null` to ignore loading the `missingImage`.
* Added White Image Support in `TextureManager`. In the game `config`, set `whiteImage` to `null` to ignore loading the `whiteImage`.
* `Phaser.Core.TimeStep#pauseDuration` is a new property that holds the duration of the most recent game pause, if any, in ms (thanks @samme)
* The Game `Events#RESUME` event now contains a new parameter `pauseDuration` which is the duration, in ms, that the game was paused for (thanks @samme)
* Added `Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#removePack` method to `LoaderPlugin` that removes resources listed in an Asset Pack.(thanks @samme)

# WebGL Rendering Updates

* `WebGLTextureWrapper.update` expanded:
  * `source` parameter is now type `?object`, so it can be used for anything that is valid in the constructor.
  * New `format` parameter can update the texture format.

# Updates

* MatterJS updated to 0.20.0 and integrated into Phaser. [Here are details about the update](MatterJS.md).
* Integrated `MatterCollisionEvents` plugin functionality directly into the `Matter.World` class to handle collisions more effectively. [More details here](MatterCollisionEvents.md).
* Updated `Matter.World` to improve the performance, accuracy, and reliability of the `update` method in handling physics simulations or animations. [More details here](MatterWorldUpdate.md).
* Calling `Timeline.pause` will now pause any currently active Tweens that the Timeline had started (thanks @monteiz)
* Calling `Timeline.resume` will now resume any currently paused Tweens that the Timeline had started (thanks @monteiz)
* Calling `Timeline.clear` and `Timeline.destroy` will now destroy any currently active Tweens that the Timeline had created. Previously, active tweens would continue to play to completion (thanks @monteiz)
* `TimelineEvent` has a new property called `tweenInstance`. If the Timeline event has a tween that has been activated, this will hold a reference to it.
* If you create a BitmapText with an invalid key it will now throw a runtime error. Previously it just issued a console warning and then crashed (thanks @samme)
* The console warnings when Audio files are missing/incorrect have been improved (thanks @samme)
* The `requestVideoFrame` polyfill has been updated to the latest release, which should resolve some SSR framework issues. Fix #6776 (thanks @lantictac)
* `ScaleManager` listeners includes checks for the `screen.orientation` object and adds/removes a `change` eventListener  method to handle screen orientation changes on mobile devices. The `orientationchange` event is still maintained for backwards compatibility. Fix #6837 (thanks @rexrainbow)
* When creating a new `TileSprite`, setting either `width` or `height` to `0` results in both values being set to the `displayFrame.width` and `displayFrame.height`. The updated logic now checks for `width` and `height` separately. If `width` is `0`, it is set to `displayFrame.width`. If `height` is `0`, it is set to `displayFrame.height`. Fix #6857 (thanks @GaryStanton)
* Updated `GetBitmapTextSize` with improved `maxWidth` calculations for wrapped text.
* `Vector3.subVectors` is a new method that will take 2 Vector3s, subtract them from each other and store the result in the Vector3 it was called on.
* The `TextStyle.setStyle` method will no longer mutate the given `style` object if it includes a numeric `fontSize` value. Fix #6863 (thanks @stormpanda)
* Calling the `Shape.Ellipse.setSize` method will internally call `updateDisplayOrigin` to retain position after a size change.
* The `BitmapText BatchChar` function now inlines all of the matrix math, avoiding 16 function calls per character rendered.

# Bug Fixes

* The `activePointers` game config option is now the correct amount of touch input pointers set. Fix #6783 (thanks @samme)
* The method `TextureManager.checkKey` will now return `false` if the key is not a string, which fixes issues where a texture could be created if a key was given that was already in use (thanks Will Macfarlane).
* Added all of the missing Loader Config values (such as `imageLoadType`) to LoaderConfig, so they now appear in the TypeScript defs.
* The `EXPAND` scale mode had a bug that prevented it from using the world bounds cameras, cutting rendering short. Fix #6767 (thanks @Calcue-dev @rexrainbow)
* Calling `getPipelineName()` on a Game Object would cause a runtime error if running under Canvas. It now simply returns `null`. Fix #6799 (thanks @samme)
* Calling the Arcade Body `setPushable(false)` method for `circle` bodies prevents the bodies from being pushed. Fix #5617 (thanks @kainage)
* Calling `addDeathZone()` on a particle emitter Game Object had a bug where the `DeathZone` used world position coordinates. `DeathZone` now uses local position coordinates following the particle emitter position. Fix #6371 (thanks @vforsh)
* Updated the `GetLineToLine` method in `GetLineToLine` to handle the case where `dx1` or `dy1` values is zero. This ensures the function correctly returns `null` in this case to prevent errors in calculations involving line segments. Fix #6579 (thanks @finscn)
* Resolved all kerning issues in WebGL bitmap text rendering. This includes adjustments to glyph positioning and spacing, ensuring accurate and visually pleasing text display across all WebGL contexts. Fix #6631 (thanks @monteiz)
* Fixed `Matter.World` bug where `group.length` returns `undefined`. Changed to `group.getLength()` to correctly return number of children in a group.
* Fixed Group vs Group collisions failing when performing a bitwise `&` operation between `body1.collisionMask` and `body2.collisionCategory`. The default `collisionMask` value is changed to `2147483647` to correctly match any `collisionCategory`. Fix #6764 (thanks @codeimpossible)
* Resolved an issue in `BitmapText` where adding a space character `' '` at the end of a line did not correctly align the vertical position of the new line. The updated calculation now correctly accounts for both line height and line spacing. Fix #6717 (thanks @wooseok123)
* Resolved an issue in `BitmapText` where an extra empty line was added when `setMaxWidth` was called, and the width of the line was less than a word. Previously, `yAdvance` was incorrectly incremented by `lineHeight + lineSpacing` for each word, leading to an unintended increase in vertical space. The correction now calculates `yAdvance` based on the `currentLine` index, ensuring that vertical spacing accurately reflects the number of lines. Fix #6807 (thanks @AlvaroNeuronup)
* Resolved an issue in `BitmapText` where adding a space character `' '` at the end of a line caused the following line of to ignore line wrapping when using `setMaxWidth`. Fix #6860 (thanks @bagyoni)
* The `Matrix4.lookAtRH` method would fail because it called two missing Vector3 methods.
* The `RenderTarget` will now automatically listen for the Renderer resize event if `autoResize` is true. This fixes an issue with Bitmap Masks where they wouldn't resize if the renderer resized. Fix #6769 (thanks @pavels)

## Input Bug Fixes

* The method `pointer.leftButtonReleased` will now return `true` when multiple mouse buttons are being pressed.
* The method `pointer.rightButtonReleased` will now return `true` when multiple mouse buttons are being pressed.
* The method `pointer.middleButtonReleased` will now return `true` when multiple mouse buttons are being pressed.
* The method `pointer.backButtonReleased` will now return `true` when multiple mouse buttons are being pressed.
* The method `pointer.forwardButtonReleased` will now return `true` when multiple mouse buttons are being pressed. Fix #6027 (thanks @michalfialadev)

# Deprecation Warning for the next release

The _next release_ of Phaser will make the following API-breaking changes:

* We are removing `Phaser.Struct.Map` and replacing it with a regular JS `Map` instance. This means methods like `contains` and `setAll` will be gone.
* We are removing `Phaser.Struct.Set` and replacing it with a regular JS `Set` instance. This means methods like `iterateLocal` will be gone.
* The `Create.GenerateTexture`, all of the Create Palettes and the `create` folder will be removed.
* The `phaser-ie9.js` entry-point will be removed along with all associated polyfills.
* The Spine 3 and Spine 4 plugins will no longer be updated. You should now use the official Phaser Spine plugin created by Esoteric Software.
