# Version 3.85.0 - Itsuki - in development

# New Features

# WebGL Rendering Updates

* `WebGLTextureWrapper.update` expanded:
  * `source` parameter is now type `?object`, so it can be used for anything that is valid in the constructor.
  * New `format` parameter can update the texture format.

# Updates

# Bug Fixes

* The `activePointers` game config option is now the correct amount of touch input pointers set. Fix #6783 (thanks @samme)
* The method `TextureManager.checkKey` will now return `false` if the key is not a string, which fixes issues where a texture could be created if a key was given that was already in use (thanks Will Macfarlane).
