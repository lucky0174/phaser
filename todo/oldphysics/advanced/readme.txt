I've been extremely busy working on a proper advanced physics system for Phaser.

It has all the sorts of things you'd expect from a real 2D physics engine and will allow for a whole new range of cool games to be made.

However I'm not 100% happy with the implementation right yet, there are still too many rough edges and places where performance can be
improved. It also adds quite a bit of extra file size to the library, so I'm not bundling it with the 1.0 release. It will be released
as a stand-alone extension to Phaser in due course.

It has been a lot of hard work to create, taking many weeks of development time and money, so be warned I may decide to charge for it.
Or I may just give it away for free, I've not yet decided - but for now I reserve that right at least.

Cheers,
